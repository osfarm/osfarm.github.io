# OSFarm [![pages-build-deployment](https://github.com/osfarm/osfarm.github.io/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment/badge.svg)](https://github.com/osfarm/osfarm.github.io/actions/workflows/pages/pages-build-deployment)

Gather, curate, and feature stories of people using and building open source project around farming.

The site is open source (here's all the code!) and is a tool _for_ and _by_ the community.

Submit [issues](https://github.com/osfarm/osfarm.github.io/issues/new) and [pull requests](https://github.com/osfarm/osfarm.github.io/compare) for stories, site ideas or copy edits.

### Goals

- Share stories of real world experiences using open source project on farm
- Demystify open source
- Showcase the community to promote connections and sharing between individuals, farms and farm organizations.

### Under the Hood

This site is made with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Liquid](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid), an open source static site generator. This means the Jekyll program takes the content we want to be on the site and turns them into HTML files ready to be hosted somewhere. Awesomely, GitHub provides free web hosting for repositories, called [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and that's how this site is hosted. The content for the site is on a branch named [main](https://github.com/osfarm/osfarm.github.io/tree/main).

#### Add Organization
